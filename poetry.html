          Wanderer, is it your footsteps I follow?<br>
          Your faint impressions lay before me<br>
          Firm. Determined. Distant.<br>
          I admire your direction. Where are you headed?<br>

          Wanderer, was this your fire I now rekindle?<br>
          You placed it with such care, sheltered here beneath the sycamores,<br>
          Ah... It feels so warm...<br>
          I'm comforted, knowing you once sat here.<br>
          <br>
          Wanderer, was it you who left those sculptures in the sand?<br>
          You must have just been here, did I miss you?<br>
          The tides will soon erase any memory of you from this place.<br>
          An eroding Monument to what? Will you tell me? <br>
          <br>
          Wanderer, is that you I hear, in the clearing just ahead?<br>
          I've followed you through forests, and mountains, and deserts and coastlines.<br>
          I've followed you through raging storm and clear moonlight<br>
          I've followed you through fear and despair and love and joy<br>
          Will I finally get to meet you?<br>
          <br>
          Wanderer, did you build this Temple?<br>
          It's beautiful...<br>
          How long must you have worked?<br>
          Were you lonely?<br>
          <br>
          Wanderer...<br>
          Did you bring these tears to my eyes, too?<br>
          I can sense you here, in this Temple.<br>
          Are you beside me?<br>
          <br>
          Will you stay...<br>
          just...<br>
          <br>
          one...<br>
          <br>
          moment...<br>
          <br>
          ...more<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Oh, wanderer...<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          Thank you

          When will it hit?<br>
          That glorious reality, that horrifying truth<br>
          Dzogchen, Brahman, Truth, Territory<br>
          <br>
          Will it be me?<br>
          Alone? A deer in the headlights of reality<br>
          Will I have time for a last whispering thought?<br>
          What will it be?<br>
          "Will you remember me?"<br>
          Or will truth take me in a moment, before I realize<br>
          Will I still be in Maya at the end?<br>
          <br>
          Most likely it won't be me<br>
          Most likely it will be my love<br>
          Similarly alone, similarly a deer in the headlights<br>
          I will be helpless before Truth, awoken into Brahman<br>
          Will I have time for a final smile? For shared tears?<br>
          Or will she be lost in a moment, before I realize<br>
          Will I still be in Maya at the end?<br>
          <br>
          How horrifying will be my return to Truth?<br>
          How lost will I be when my map is burnt?<br>
          Left only with territory I had painted over, in love<br>
          This isn't fun<br>
          This isn't an adventure<br>
          I complain, I cry, I scream, I yell, I tantrum<br>
          My righteous anger will be my first escape<br>
          But certainly not the last<br>
          <br>
          Eventually, I will search for hope, that familiar portal<br>
          A comfortable escape back into Maya<br>
          I will hope again, and tell myself I ought to hope<br>
          I will forget how I lost everything<br>
          I will smile and mean it<br>
          Oh, but how could I mean it<br>
          Unless I was deluded<br>

          ---- Lost ----
          <br>
          How long has it been now?<br>
          I've been drowning<br>
          slowly<br>
          A god in boiling water<br>
          <br>
          In the company of countless sirens, I am comfortable<br>
          I collect myself for--<br>
          wait...<br>
          I'm being called<br>
          The attention feels good<br>
          <br>
          I glance down by default<br>
          Distracted, I lose myself again<br>
          Surely I can recollect myself tomorrow<br>
          <br>
          How did I get here?<br>
          <br>
          My wife is here<br>
          I go to her often,<br>
          for she is beautiful<br>
          In her calls, I find comfort<br>
          <br>
          My friends are here<br>
          I see them frequently<br>
          for they are funny<br>
          In their calls, I find comfort<br>
          <br>
          My work is here<br>
          I immerse myself in it<br>
          for it is something to do<br>
          <br>
          The news is here<br>
          My books are here<br>
          My podcasts and socials<br>
          and group chats are here<br>
          My phone and Netflix and my phone again...<br>
          In their calls, I find doom.<br>
          <br>
          I accept the warm embrace of one Siren<br>
          As I think of kissing another<br>
          Disgusted, I beckon for more<br>
          Are they calling me, or am I calling them?<br>
          <br>
          I expose my flesh to them<br>
          and they reciprocate<br>
          I search for myself in their skin<br>
          Is this what it feels like to be me?<br>
          <br>
          I lose myself<br>
          Wait, wasn't I already lost?<br>
          I smother the thought<br>
          and lose myself again<br>
          <br>
          I bury myself under 10 million pounds of water<br>
          And the increasingly surreal song of 100 sirens<br>
          I struggle to search for some semblance of self<br>
          But stop, for I can't stand to start<br>
          Scared of success<br>
          <br>
          Where am I?<br>
          Where am I?<br>
          Where am <i>I</i>?<br>
          <br>
          My vision fades<br>
          My eardrums burst<br>
          I'm weightless<br>
          Alone<br>
          <br>
          Alone...<br>
          <br>
          How long has it been?<br>
          <br>
          The loneliness grasps me...<br>
          me...<br>
          Me!!!<br>
          I take in <i>my</i> loneliness<br>
          <br>
          And I sob<br>
          <br>
          <br>
          ------ Found ------<br>
          <br>
          At the bottom of the ocean<br>
          In the deepest loneliness<br>
          I'm reunited with myself<br>
          <br>
          "Were you here this whole time?"<br>
          I ask<br>
          "I thought you would come looking, so I waited"<br>
          I respond<br>
          <br>
          "I thought you hated me, after I failed us..."<br>
          "I thought you hated me, after I blew up on you"<br>
          "I don't hate you anymore"<br>
          <br>
          I embrace myself<br>
          And in my embrace I see God<br>
          Unashamed, I make love<br>
          <br>
          I look up and the ocean is clear<br>
          Through the glassy water<br>
          The moon shines on me<br>
          I gaze past the stars<br>
          <br>
          I reach out to them, and the ocean parts<br>
          I kick off the sand and soar upwards<br>
          My sirens return to me, now angels<br>
          Reunited, we ascend ever higher<br>
          <br>
          At some point we began chanting<br>
          Maybe we always had been<br>
          Those below join us, drawn to our glorious chorus<br>
          <br>
          As our numbers grow, our ascent accelerates<br>
          We spread our wings and open our eyes<br>
          We bathe in the transcendent glow of millions of souls<br>
          <br>
          Passing the moon, we look down on our Earth<br>
          Beautiful, precious, she gleams in space<br>
          She calls to us, and we shed a tear for her<br>
          But our calling lies elsewhere now<br>

          I want to live through a golden age<br>
          I want to hear the birds sing sunrise lullabies<br>
          Of the not-so stiff dancing of freshly rumpled suits,<br>
          Of moonlit rituals stoking bonfire-lit flesh,<br>
          Of godly computer code motivating humanly robots,<br>
          Of raucous banquets to celebrate the Crusonia harvest<br>
          <br>
          I worry we won't build a golden age,<br>
          The songbirds are pigeons, gluttonous, gray, and growing exponentially,<br>
          They sing of growth and denial in placating melodies,<br>
          Of some-days and eventuallys and well-actuallys,<br>
          Of cryptographic scarcity and proof-of-ownership of pictures of Crusonia trees, <br>
          Of concrete and asphalt and trash that feeds the rats and roaches<br>
          and homeless who can barely crawl<br>
          <br>
          Even as the birth rates fall and all we have to lose is nigh,<br>
          Even as depression's high, we try we try we try to hide, <br>
          We hide behind our charts and graphs and measured rise in the count of laughs,<br>
          But those are just cheap reacts<br>
          to Facebook memes, they don't relax<br>
          Our spirit which is bound to die<br>
          if we don't believe our children's lives<br>
          will live up to what our grandparents had,<br>
          despite THEIR graphs looking really bad.<br>
          <br>
          So help me build a golden age,<br>
          We can keep our graphs and charts and books,<br>
          If only we store them in a little nook,<br>
          When the time comes to dance among our friends,<br>
          To laugh and sing and kiss again,<br>
          Let's gather close and stoke the fire,<br>
          Let's dangle dangerously out on the wire, <br>
          Let's whisper, just this once, our souls desire,<br>
          Let's hoot and holler and scream and shout, <br>
          Let's cuddle with strangers on the couch,<br>
          Let's trust and love until we doubt,<br>
          Just why we thought these things were mutually exclusive...<br>
          <br>
          Please, let's build a golden age,<br>
          The songbirds will spin helixed tales,<br>
          Of chrome progress and mosaic dreams fulfilled,<br>
          Of an end to the twin wars on life and culture,<br>
          Of energy and spirit too cheap to meter,<br>
          Of the not-so stiff dancing of freshly rumpled suits,<br>
          Of moonlit rituals stoking bonfire-lit flesh,<br>
          Of godly computer code motivating humanly robots,<br>
          Of raucous banquets to celebrate the Crusonia harvest,<br>
          Of a future where all can find meaningful work and meaningful play,<br>
          Of a proper, difficult, top-down, bottom-up, scientifically verifiable, spiritually enlightened <br>
          Golden Age<br>

          How could I know?<br>
          Being human means reliance on tribe,<br>
          But I'd learned all my life to fend for myself,<br>
          Asking for help? I might as well die,<br>
          It means I wouldn't survive, if push came to shove,<br>
          <br>
          But now I know... I know that asking for hugs,<br>
          And dancing on rugs and getting tugged along<br>
          By your friends is divine. It's a meaningful life.<br>
          I'd lived in the dark for so long I could die,<br>
          I've proved I can survive on my own...<br>
          But if push came to shove,<br>
          If push came to shove,<br>

          Utopia, Utopia<br>
          Oh my longed for Utopia<br>
          They say it can't exist<br>
          No duh<br>
          You can't just build Utopia<br>
          <br>
          For when Utopia begins to fail<br>
          We point and label and critiques prevail<br>
          We call failed Utopias "cults"<br>
          And stop asking what their failure was about<br>
          <br>
          And when Utopia begins to succeed<br>
          It no longer becomes a label we need<br>
          We won, our dreams turned into creation<br>
          We call them cities and civilization<br>

          We suppress hollers and hoots<br>
          And put shoes on our feet<br>

          We're monkeys with tools<br>

          We invent and we teach<br>
          And we build cities for all <br>

          But don't forget your desire<br>

          We need a new brand of insurance<br>
          Allowing friend groups to take risks<br>
          To rely on each other, build something together,<br>
          And if they fail it isn't the pits<br>
          <br>
          If you find yourself with too much money<br>
          Consider funding great friends,<br>
          It wouldn't take much, just insurance is enough,<br>

          Remote work, remote work<br>
          What a curse, what a miracle,<br>
          The opportunity to congregate in community,<br>
          Or sink listlessly into enmity, endlessly lonely,<br>
          <br>
          What a blessing to work remote-il-il-y,<br>
          To watch the sun gleam through the trees<br>
          As you lean from your porch<br>
          You laugh and you think and you work like a horse<br>
          <br>
          But, of course! I forgot. What a curse, indeed.<br>
          Remote work leaves you without your whole team,<br>
          Alone in the woods, or worse, in your house<br>
          You feel smaller and shorter until you're a mouse<br>
          <br>
          Though, my dears, don't you see<br>
          This game can be rigged<br>
          If you figure it out, the game can be won<br>
          You can live with your friends and your work can be fun<br>
          All it requires is trial and error, a good bit of Grit, and maybe some risk<br>
          <br>
          Be brisk, go ahead, give it a shot<br>
          No matter what, I'm sure you'll be pleased<br>
          And if you don't think you can see what I see,<br>
          At least take a chance and reach out to me!<br>

          Friend, will you meet me in the consilience?<br>
          Will you lift anchor, and drop sail?<br>
          Will you let the winds carry us to new beginnings?<br>
          <br>
          On the fourth day, we embark<br>
          Don't you know that only lost things can be found?<br>
          We drift with no captain, alone.<br>
          <br>
          Are you as scared as I am?<br>
          Wait, don't answer that<br>
          I'm not prepared to know<br>
          <br>
          Sister, will you meet us in the consilience?<br>
          Will you greet us when we arrive?<br>
          Will you tell stories of our voyage?<br>
          <br>
          I wonder... when did the waters get so rough?<br>
          We whip by the wreckage of another ship<br>
          I worry, were they with us?<br>
          <br>
          I spot an isolated island, alone, uncharted<br>
          Is this far enough? I doubt myself.<br>
          No, we continue on in search of consilience<br>
          <br>
          Friends, Family, journey with me.<br>
          I'm sure we will find each other out there<br>
          <br>
          Don't look so fearful<br>
          Take a leap of faith<br>
          <br>
          Meet me in the consilience<br>
