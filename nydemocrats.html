    <p>The goal of our group is to <strong>HAVE FUN</strong> and <strong>DISCUSS PROMISING IDEAS</strong> for the democratic party while being <strong>NON-CONFORMIST</strong>, <strong>EXPERIMENTAL</strong>, <strong>KIND</strong>, <strong>OPTIMISTIC</strong>, and <strong>HAPPY</strong>.</p>

    <p>This is important because currently the democratic party is very <strong>DOOMY</strong> and <strong>UNFUN</strong> and <strong>ANGRY</strong> and <strong>DEPRESSED</strong> and <strong>CONFORMIST</strong> and <strong>HAS MANY BAD IDEAS</strong> and <strong>IS MEAN</strong> and <strong>UNSAFE</strong> to people who share verboten ideas.</p>

    <!-- <p>You are welcome to disagree with the above claims, but if they make you really mad, then probably this isn't the group for you. This is a group where people should feel comfortable saying things far more controversial than "the democratic party sucks" without fear of anger or contempt.</p>

    <p>I belive that good relationships and good society are worth <strong>FAR FAR</strong> more than consensus, so please don't blow up relationships over disagreements. Just drop it and be polite. We don't need to have consensus.</p> -->

    <p><strong>TO THAT END</strong>: This etiquette is designed to maintain a vibe of high trust, experimentation, novel ideas, and playfulness. Do not crush the vibe.</p>

    <h2></h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>Be concrete; no bullshitting</strong><br>
        <span style="font-size: 0.8rem;">Asking "why do you think that?" is always okay.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Collaborate and have a good, pleasant time doing politics</strong><br>
        <span style="font-size: 0.8rem;">Hatred, contempt, doomerism, and complaining should be taken elsewhere -- we are here to improve our ideas, improve the ideas of the Democratic Party, and get shit done. Seriously, no political contempt for your enemies, no discussion of egregious sins of enemies, no hate porn. We all read the news already. This will be policed.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>We Discuss Politics, Not News</strong><br>
        <span style="font-size: 0.8rem;">Please do not post news unless you are asking your own relevant questions or sharing your own ideas/theories. We're all on Twitter already. We are here to discuss novel, interesting, promising political ideas, not news. <strong>ESPECIALLY</strong> no rage-bait or sensationalist headlines. If I wanted to hear the ideas of <strong>CNN</strong> and the <strong>NYT</strong>, I would visit their website, not this group chat.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Good Ideas Really Matter</strong><br>
        <span style="font-size: 0.8rem;">Please encourage each other's ideas. Please share promising ideas that you find in the wild. Please theorize in public.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Good Humor Really Matters</strong><br>
        <span style="font-size: 0.8rem;">Laugh, smile, shitpost, and be merry! The Democratic Party is far too solemn, and we need to have fun. Enjoying life is a pre-requisite to good politics. An enjoyable party is a pre-requisite to a good party.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>Model Good Behavior</strong><br>
        <span style="font-size: 0.8rem;">We all take cues from each other. Let's lead each other to a much better way of being, not just better policy.</span>
      </li>

      <li>
        <strong>No Activism</strong><br>
        <span style="font-size: 0.8rem;">Our goal is not to protest for a specific political objective, but rather to shape how politics is done in the first place so it requires less distress and frustration and activism. We're not trying to complain about how things are, we're trying to understand how things are, and then build the thing that is better.</span>
